    <h1> Now You See Me... Now You Don't </h1>

    <p> Inspired by Chester the cat, the mirror from the Shrek Movies & The Invisible man </p>
    <p> Now You See Me... Now You Don't, is a mini hide n' seek. By your movements, and swaying your head from each edge of your screen, side to side and to the rhythm of the music you control when you are seen ( by being still) and when you disappear. But it's only for a short while until you pop up again. Don't forget to click on your mouse to start!
